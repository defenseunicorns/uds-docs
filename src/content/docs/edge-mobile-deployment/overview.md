UDS is a secure software delivery product purpose-built for National Security missions—proven in data center environments and now expanded to the tactical edge. While UDS excels in the enterprise setting, the newly introduced component of UDS brings that same dependable platform to remote, resource-constrained, and low-connectivity locations. Designed to support critical operations anywhere from forward operating bases to on-board vehicles, UDS Tactical Edge ensures continuous, secure, and efficient software delivery, regardless of the environment.

UDS deploys and manages applications that run within a Kubernetes cluster hosted on a Linux server and as such most UDS services, including UDS Core, operate within the cluster. UDS also includes client applications that allow a variety of devices to interact with these UDS services and to deploy and manage UDS applications. These clients operate on their respective devices such as tablets and smartphones for the UDS mobile application and macOS and Linux laptops and desktops for UDS CLI.

        <li>Warfighters risk their safety and efficiency when managing outdated systems—reduce exposure and streamline updates with bundled packages that deliver seamless, all-in-one application and platform upgrades, eliminating the need for fragile, patchwork scripts.</li>
        <li>Certified system administrators aren’t always available to perform software updates, which delays critical operations. UDS enables warfighters to deploy updates themselves, decentralizing software management and keeping assets in the fight.</li>

## Real-World Applications  

| **Domain** | **Problem** | **Solution** |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Joint Command & Control (JADC2 & Multi-Domain Ops)** | The DoD wants to create a unified data mesh across domains, but platforms are incompatible, software updates are inconsistent, and portability is lacking between cloud, on-prem, and edge. | UDS delivers cross-platform software portability, ensuring seamless, secure updates across diverse environments while enabling interoperability between legacy and modern systems. |
| **Air** | Fighter jets like the F-35 suffer from costly sustainment cycles due to software complexity and update delays. | UDS enables seamless, automated software updates with containerized mission applications, reducing downtime and sustainment costs. |
| **Sea** | Naval systems require costly, manual software updates that degrade readiness and increase cyber vulnerabilities. Additionally, airgapped vessels like submarines have avoided adopting modern technology due to non-connectivity environments. | Secure, airgapped containerized applications that enable zero-downtime updates, improving fleet availability. Our airgapped processes can bring modern enterprise applications to submarines, increasing productivity and quality of life while underway. |
| **Land** | Aging ground combat systems require frequent, complex software updates, increasing sustainment costs and limiting adaptability. | UDS enables rapid, low-SWaP software deployment that keeps platforms like tanks and armored vehicles mission-ready with minimal logistics burden. |
| **Cyber & Electronic Warfare (EW)** | Mission-critical cyber and EW tools require frequent updates to counter evolving threats, but legacy software delivery models are slow and ineffective. | UDS supports airgapped, rapid-deployment cyber tools, enabling warfighters to update and deploy defensive/offensive capabilities instantly. |
| **Special Operations Forces (SOF)** | SOF teams operate in low-infrastructure, high-risk environments, making traditional sustainment and software updates impossible. | UDS minimizes Size, Weight, and Power by deploying secure, portable applications that run autonomously on edge devices. |
| **Unmanned Systems (Sea, Air, Land, Space)** | Autonomous systems require frequent mission updates, but real-time connectivity is often disrupted in contested environments. | UDS enables secure, AI-driven autonomy stacks that can be preloaded and updated in the field, ensuring mission adaptability. |
| **Expeditionary & Tactical Operation Centers** | Forward bases require self-sustaining software environments that can operate independently for extended periods. | UDS delivers hardened, containerized mission applications with automated sustainment capabilities, reducing dependency on external IT support. |
| **DevSecOps & CI/CD for Tactical Edge** | Traditional software updates are slow, manual, and expensive, increasing lifecycle costs and limiting adaptability. | UDS enables automated, secure CI/CD pipelines for mission software, reducing sustainment costs while ensuring continuous capability enhancement. |
