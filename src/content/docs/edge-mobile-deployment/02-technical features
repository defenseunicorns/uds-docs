This is achieved through:
- **Functional Layer Paradigm**: UDS Core’s modular architecture allows unnecessary features to be omitted, optimizing for size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints.
- **UDS Remote Agent**: A critical service that enables remote operation, facilitating control and monitoring of edge deployments. While primarily for UDS Edge, it can also benefit hub-spoke cloud deployments.
- **UDS Android App**: Designed to provide a mobile interface, ensuring accessibility and operational efficiency in austere environments.

While these services may not be exclusive to UDS Tactical Edge, this implementation serves as their primary use case in the near term, ensuring lightweight, efficient, and flexible deployment models tailored for tactical edge missions.

## UDS Technical Features

### **1. Distributed Software and Asset Management**
- UDS enables declarative versioning of application states, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments across a distributed fleet.
- Automated or semi-automated execution allows less-experienced personnel to manage deployments, reducing system administrator workload.
- Supports smooth, incremental updates that minimize operational disruptions while maintaining software integrity across disconnected and contested environments.

### **2. Integrate Once, Deploy Anywhere**
- Operator-based architecture allows applications to dynamically adapt to their environment.
- Automates infrastructure configuration, including:
  - Domain name management via UDS Package custom resources.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) integration.
  - Network policy automation.
  - Metrics monitoring and logging.
- Ensures seamless application portability across cloud, on-premise, and edge environments.

### **3. Interface Built for Use in Combat Operations**
- Designed for high-stakes environments where user focus on the mission is critical to survival.
- Simplifies complex deployments, making software updates and management intuitive.
- Actively incorporates real user feedback to surface critical information while removing unnecessary distractions.

### **4. Airgapped Mission Applications Where You Need It**
- UDS manages software updates via declarative Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts.
- These artifacts include:
  - Application binaries.
  - Defined end-state configurations.
  - Compliance artifacts for security validation.
- Ensures that UDS-deployed applications are self-contained, portable, and built on open standards, enabling seamless transport and deployment anywhere the mission requires.

With these features, UDS Edge provides a battlefield-ready platform that ensures operational efficiency, security, and adaptability for modern warfighting environments.
