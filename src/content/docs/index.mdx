The Unicorn Delivery Service (UDS) enables secure software delivery into highly regulated or egress-limited environments enabling your teams to deploy and run the mission-critical applications required, wherever needed. UDS offers a comprehensive suite of tools tailored for mission operations, spanning software development, generative AI, defensive cyber, collaboration, and secure access management. If a required mission applications is not present in the ecosystem, users have the ability to choose a commercial or open-source application and specify the target environment for implementation.

UDS integrates with Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) to streamline Authority to Operate (ATO) processes, enabling secure and compliant software deployments. The open-source platform is designed to facilitate repeatable, reliable, and secure runtime environments to deploy mission applications into any environment.

## Key Features

**Declarative Baseline:**  Rapidly establishes secure and repeatable runtime environments via declarative baselines. GitOps workflows manage declarative baselines to ensure consistent, efficient deployment and safeguard critical applications.

**Software Capabilities:** Ensures continuous improvement and adaptation through synchronization with upstream providers, utilization of hardened images, and testing against common platforms and infrastructures.

**Infrastructure Agnostic:** Provides flexible software deployment across classified and unclassified cloud, on-premises, and edge environments, ensuring that your software successfully deploys and runs wherever the mission needs it.

**No Data or Vendor Lock:** Leverages open-source technologies to ensure data sovereignty and enhance flexibility while eliminating the limitations of data lock-in and vendor constraints.
