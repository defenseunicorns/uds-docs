        <li>Warfighters risk their safety and efficiency when operating outdated systems—reduce exposure and streamline updates with bundled packages that deliver seamless, all-in-one application and platform upgrades, eliminating the need for fragile, patchwork scripts.</li>
        <li>Certified system administrators aren’t always available to perform software updates, which delays critical operations. UDS enables warfighters to deploy updates themselves, decentralizing software management and keeping assets in the fight.</li>

| **Domain** | **Problem** | **Solution** |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Joint Command & Control (JADC2 & Multi-Domain Ops)** | The DoD wants to create a unified data mesh across domains, but platforms are incompatible, software updates are inconsistent, and portability is lacking between cloud, on-prem, and edge. | UDS enables interoperability between legacy and modern systems through hardware-agnostic software portability, ensuring seamless and secure updates across diverse environments. For joint C2 to become a reality, portability and air-gapped operations at the edge must be foundational. |
| **Air** | Aircraft suffer from costly sustainment cycles due to software complexity and update delays. | UDS enables seamless, automated software updates for containerized mission applications, reducing downtime and sustainment costs. Our product is built to modernize legacy platforms and keep next-gen platforms updated and secure. |
| **Sea** | Naval systems require costly, manual software updates that degrade readiness and increase cyber vulnerabilities. Additionally, airgapped vessels like submarines have avoided adopting modern technology due to non-connectivity environments. | Secure, airgapped, containerized applications that enable zero-downtime updates, improving fleet availability. Our airgapped processes can bring modern enterprise applications to our submarine force, increasing productivity and quality of life while underway. |
| **Land** | Aging ground combat systems require frequent, complex software updates, increasing sustainment costs and limiting adaptability. | UDS enables rapid, low-Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) software deployment that keeps platforms like tanks and armored vehicles mission-ready with minimal logistics burden. |
| **Cyber & Electronic Warfare (EW)** | Mission-critical cyber and EW tools require frequent updates to counter evolving threats, but legacy software delivery models are slow and ineffective. | Cyber and EW is the tip of the spear for DoD software capabilities. UDS supports airgapped, rapid deployment, enabling warfighters to update and deploy cyber tools and algorithms at the speed of relevance on the battlefield. |
| **Special Operations Forces (SOF)** | SOF teams operate in low-infrastructure, high-risk environments, making traditional sustainment and software updates impossible. | UDS minimizes Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), allowing SOF operators to carry more AI-powered devices on the frontlines. |
| **Unmanned Systems (Sea, Air, Land, Space)** | Autonomous systems require frequent mission updates, but real-time connectivity is often disrupted in contested environments. | UDS enables secure, Kubernetes workloads, which can be preloaded and updated in the field to ensure mission adaptability. |
| **Expeditionary & Tactical Operation Centers** | Forward bases require self-sustaining software environments that can operate independently for extended periods. | UDS delivers hardened, containerized mission applications with automated sustainment capabilities, reducing dependency on external IT support. This approach enables supporting software factories at the enterprise level and applications at the edge level. |
| **DevSecOps & CI/CD for Tactical Edge** | Traditional software updates are slow, manual, and expensive, increasing lifecycle costs and limiting adaptability. | UDS provides a declarative deployment model, ensuring that what you develop and test will behave consistently in a production environment. |
